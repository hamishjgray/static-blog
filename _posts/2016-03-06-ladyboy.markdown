## World famous in New Zealand, Napier holds the title for Art Deco capital.

This amazing little city suffered a devastating 7.9 magnitude earthquake in 1931 which levelled much of the city, and killed 256 people. A further 525 aftershocks were recorded in the following two weeks.

### Two years later, a new Napier rose out of the devastation.

A by-product of the horrible event was the flat land on which Marine Parade's gardens, memorials and soundshell were built. Napier's art deco and modernist architecture, already in vogue in the United States, was seen as an affordable way of rebuilding.

Now, 85 years on, every year Napier puts on the Art Deco festival where people from all around the country come together in Napier in their best '30s style clothing to celebrate the city, and enjoy the festivities!
